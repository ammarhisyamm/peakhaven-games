# Peak Haven Arcade production app

Production: https://peakhaven-arcade.vercel.app/#play

The Vercel `peakhaven-arcade` project deploys this directory from `main`.
Every push or merge into `main` triggers a production build. Other branches
get preview deployments. Takiyoruu already has write access to this repository.

## Where to make changes

- Gameplay engines, rules, sounds and game artwork: `../dist/`.
- V2 pages (Play, Ranks, Prizes, My Bottle), layout and page artwork: `ui/`.
- Game iframe navigation, HUD and session bridge: `ui/game/app.js`.
- V2 toolbar spacing and line-clear feedback styles: `ui/game/arcade-overrides.css`.

`npm run build` assembles the current gameplay source and the V2 interface into
`build/`. The original `../dist/app.js` remains the original arcade demo; it does
not replace the production V2 interface. Changes to game modules and artwork in
`../dist/` are copied automatically on every build, with no manual asset sync.

The build checks JavaScript syntax and local imports before publishing. If the
build fails, the last successful production deployment keeps serving traffic.
`/version.json` exposes the deployed Git commit for release verification.

## Local preview

From this directory:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open http://localhost:8775/#play.

## Vercel settings

- Repository: `ammarhisyamm/peakhaven-games`
- Production branch: `main`
- Root directory: `arcade`
- Include source files outside root directory: enabled (gameplay lives in `../dist`)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `build`
- Ignored Build Step: `exit 1` (build every push, including changes in gameplay source)

No GitHub Actions token or deployment hook is needed; Vercel's Git integration
performs automatic builds and assigns the production domain after success.

## Daily Play reference

Play follows the supplied October 13 layout: campaign hero, monthly/yearly
prizes, Peak Blocks / Sequence / Ridge Run rows, leaderboard preview, bottle
customisation shortcut and extra-plays concept. `ui/play.css` scopes the layout
to Play, preserving the other pages. Square game illustrations use `contain`
with no cropping; original supplied images are preserved in `source-assets/`.

The prototype tracks three free game launches per game per local calendar day
on this device. A launch is counted when the instruction dialog's start button
is pressed; cancelling instructions uses no play. In-game retries retain the
existing engine behavior. Extra-play purchasing remains a Pricing TBC concept.
